  /**
   * Runtime type information.  This module defines the mapping from
   * runtime objects to their runtime type information.  See the types
   * module for the definition of how type information is represented.
   *
   * Runtime objects fall into four main categories:
   *
   *   - Things represented by javascript primitives, such as
   *     null, numbers, booleans, strings, and symbols.  For these
   *     we map directly from the javascript type (given by typeof)
   *     to the appropriate class type from core, which serves as their
   *     rtti.
   *
   *   - Functions, which are represented by javascript functions.
   *     Representations of Dart functions always have a
   *     _runtimeType property attached to them with the appropriate
   *     rtti.
   *
   *   - Objects (instances) which are represented by instances of
   *     javascript (ES6) classes.  Their types are given by their
   *     classes, and the rtti is accessed by projecting out their
   *     constructor field.
   *
   *   - Types objects, which are represented as described in the types
   *     module.  Types always have a _runtimeType property attached to
   *     them with the appropriate rtti.  The rtti for these is always
   *     core.Type.  TODO(leafp): consider the possibility that we can
   *     reliably recognize type objects and map directly to core.Type
   *     rather than attaching this property everywhere.
